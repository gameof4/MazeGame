     The developers at Game of 4 are dedicated members of a team that values team work, as well as communication. We completed this project over the span of three scrums. For everyone who enjoyes our game, I would like to say thank you. Our team will continue to improve our game to give the greatest gaming experience possible to players. Our scrum master Nolan Murrell, did an excellent job of encouraging his team members and building this amazing website. In addition, our product owner Peter Woolsey, did a great job of helping the group overall and helping to come up with the ideas for our game. Robert Muroni, one of our coders, did an excellent job of creating a game that will captivate every player. Last but certainly not least, Michael Chen, helped to code our game and was essential to our creation of a breathtaking product.
