    The developers at Game of 4 are dedicated to working together to create the best product possible, as efficiently as possible. We work to achieve this efficiency through clear communication and strategic leadership. By using the Agile Scrum method, the development of our product was accelerated and changes were enacted where needed. We completed this project over the span of three scrums. 
    <br>
    Our scrum master, Nolan Murrell, did an excellent job of encouraging his team members and building an amazing website. In addition, our product owner, Peter Woolsey, helped to come up with the ideas for our game while maintaining the GitHub Repository. Robert Muroni, one of our coders, did an excellent job of creating a game that will captivate every player. Last but certainly not least, Michael Chen, helped to code our game and was essential to our creation of a breathtaking product.
